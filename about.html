        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hey there! I'm Syeon Dsouza, a student currently pursuing BSc.IT at
          <a href="https://arnoldscollegeandheri.edu.in/">
            St. Arnold Degree College</a
          >. My journey into tech began during junior college — not just using
          devices, but understanding how systems work and interact. That
          curiosity led me to explore programming, web development, and
          databases.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm currently focused on building clean, interactive websites and
          learning the foundations of C++, HTML/CSS, and DBMS. I enjoy designing
          user interfaces that feel intuitive and engaging.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of tech, I love reading tech blogs, playing chess, and
          strumming my guitar. I believe in learning by doing, and I'm always up
          for building something new.
